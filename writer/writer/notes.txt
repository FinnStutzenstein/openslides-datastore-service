Common notes I found important to write down during development:

- Functions starting with `assert` does not return anything, but raise errors.
- The high-level-services get data from low-level-code. Data formats are stated in high-level-services. In the low-level, just the datatypes must be checked, in the high level the content of this data. Example WriteRequest: The low-level-code must ensure, that locked_fields is a dict of strings to numbers. The high-level-service ensures, that the keys are valid and numbers positive.
